        <p>Hello my wonderful readers! My name is Kyle and I am excited  to tell you a little bit about myself. <br> 
           Here are a few facts about me... <br>  </p>
        <p>My family and I live in Davis County, Utah.  I have been married for 13 years to my very best friend <br> 
        and the love of my life. Together we have 5 wonderful, but extremely busy kids. Their ages range from <br>
        11 years old to 1 year old twins. So between running kids to football practice and changing diapers, we <br>
         are exhausted (but in a good way)! They are my motivation and my life.  </p>
        <p>I started my education at Weber State, but took a few years off while life got busy.  I am excited to be <br>
         back at it and even more excited to learn.  My degree is in programming. I would like to learn more about how <br>
         the Tech world works and would love to be apart of this industry. I would eventually like to get into cyber <br> 
         security and help prevent potential problems that people run into.  Welcome to my page!</p>
