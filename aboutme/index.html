    <p>Hello my wonderful readers! My name is Kyle and I am excited to tell you a bit about myself. <br>Here are a few facts about me...<br>
    MY family and I live in Davis coounty, Utah. I have been married for 13 years to my best friend and the love of my life. Together we<br>
    hace 5 wonderful, but extremely busy kids. Their ages range from 11 years old to 1 year old twins. So, between runnung kids to fotball<br> 
    practice and changing diapers, we are exhausted (but in a good way)! They are my motivation and my life.
    </p>
    <p>I started my education at Weber State University but took a few years off while life got busy. I am excited to be back at it and even<br>
     more excited to learn about how the Tech world works. I would eventually like to get into cyber security and help prevent potential<br>
    problems that people run into. </p>
